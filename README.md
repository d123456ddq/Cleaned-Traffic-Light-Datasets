# Cleaned-Traffic-Light-Datasets
Various datasets on traffic light (TL) detection are aggregated and cleaned. They include [ApolloScape](http://data.apollo.auto/?locale=en-us&lang=en), [Bosch Small TL Dataset](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/6132/), [WPI TL Dataset](http://computing.wpi.edu/dataset.html), and [Kaggle LISA TL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mbornoe/lisa-traffic-light-dataset/data). 

Admittedly, this repository is by no means complete, or original, but it is intended for rapid evaluation of traffic light detection algorithms. For that purpose, two simple scripts are provided - one that generate the needed dataset, and another that calculates accuracy.
